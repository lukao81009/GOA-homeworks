    <h2  align="center">Welcome to Georgia!</h2><br><br>
    <h5>
        Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory, 
        hosting the world's earliest known sites of winemaking,
        gold mining, and textiles. The classical era saw the
        emergence of several kingdoms, such as Colchis and 
        Iberia, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian 
        state. In the early fourth century, Georgians 
        officially adopted Christianity, which contributed 
        to the unification into the Kingdom of Georgia. 
        Georgia reached its Golden Age during the High Middle 
        Ages under the reigns of King David IV and Queen Tamar.
        Beginning in the 15th century, the kingdom declined 
        and disintegrated under pressure from various regional
        powers, including the Mongols, the Ottoman Empire, 
        and Persia, before being gradually annexed into the 
        Russian Empire starting in 1801.</h5>

    <h2 align="center">Welcome to Barcelona!</h2>
    <h4>Barcelona is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. 
        It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous 
        community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[8] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.3 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Bes√≤s, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9] In the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia.</h4>

    <h2 align="center">Welcome to Istambul!!</h2>
    <h4>Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey, 
    straddling the Bosporus Strait, the boundary between Europe 
    and Asia. It is considered the country's economic, cultural
    and historic capital. The city has a population of over 15 
    million residents, comprising 19% of the population of 
    Turkey,[3] and is the most populous city in Europe and 
    the world's sixteenth-largest city. The city was founded as 
    Byzantium in the 7th century BCE by Greek settlers from 
    Megara.[9] In 330 CE, the Roman emperor Constantine the 
    Great made it his imperial capital, renaming it first as 
    New Rome (Ancient Greek: ŒùŒ≠Œ± ·ø¨œéŒºŒ∑ Nea Rhomƒì; Latin: Nova 
    Roma)[10] and then finally as Constantinople 
    (Constantinopolis) after himself.[10][11] In 1930, 
    the city's name was officially changed to Istanbul, 
    the Turkish rendering of Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ†œåŒªŒπŒΩ eis t·∏ïn P√≥lin 
    'to the City', the appellation Greek speakers used since 
    the 11th century to colloquially refer to the city. 
    The city served as an imperial capital for almost 1600 years: 
    during the Byzantine (330‚Äì1204), Latin (1204‚Äì1261), 
    late Byzantine (1261‚Äì1453), and Ottoman (1453‚Äì1922) empires.
    The city grew in size and influence, eventually becoming a 
    beacon of the Silk Road and one of the most important cities
    in history. The city played a key role in the advancement 
    of Christianity during Roman/Byzantine times, hosting four 
    of the first seven ecumenical councils before its 
    transformation to an Islamic stronghold following the Fall 
    of Constantinople in 1453 CE‚Äîespecially after becoming the
    seat of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1517. In 1923, after 
    the Turkish War of Independence, Ankara replaced the city 
    as the capital of the newly formed Republic of Turkey.</h4>
